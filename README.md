## the problem

make your unit tests more interesting with cool names of spider-man comic characters instead of well-known guy `'John Doe'`

## this solution

this module exposes an API for you to get a random character name every time you call it

## installation

this module is distributed via NPM which is bundled with Node.js and should be installed as one of your project's dependencies:

```
npm install spider-man-names
```

or

```
yarn add spider-man-names
```

alternatively you can get the UMD build which is also published to the npm registry and is therefore available via https://unpkg.com:

* https://unpkg.com/spider-man-names@latest/dist/index.umd.js
* https://unpkg.com/spider-man-names@latest/dist/index.umd.min.js

the UMD build exposes the module as a global called `spiderManNames` or as an unnamed module for AMD/CommonJS (require it by its file path)

## usage

```javascript
const spiderManNames = require('spider-man-names') // CommonJS
console.log(spiderManNames.random()) // Lizard
```

## API

| Method   | Result type | Result description      |
| -------- | ----------- | ----------------------- |
| all      | array       | all character's names   |
| random() | string      | random character's name |
